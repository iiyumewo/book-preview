I don’t just walk through the woods. I feel them. When the leaves shake in the wind, they tickle my skin. When I step on fallen branches, the snaps move through my feet. I can’t see Sacred, but I know he’s here and he isn’t far. Where is he? To my left? To my right? I shake the bowl, and even though I can’t hear the cereal pinging around, I can feel it. I know this will bring Sacred out of his hiding place.

“Sacred?” I call. “Sacred?”

I wonder if I should invent a sign name for Sacred. Dogs can learn sign language, easy. They can probably learn faster than people. I think I read that somewhere.

I’ve been trying to learn sign language, because I read that there are deaf people who know two languages—spoken English and American Sign Language—and I want to learn both. But it’s tough when you don’t have a teacher. I tried learning online, but it’s hard to make any real sentences except “How are you?” and “What’s your name?” I asked my parents once if I could take a class, but they don’t think it’s necessary because of my hearing aids. But the hearing aids don’t work by themselves. I have to be able to see people’s faces so I can put the sounds and lip movements together. Like two pieces in a puzzle. People always say, “Oh, I know,” when I remind them to face me and talk slowly, but they still forget. Even my parents. They don’t mean to, but they do.

I’m the only one who doesn’t forget, because I’m the only one solving the puzzle.

I call for Sacred again, and I wait.

It takes a while, but Sacred finally comes out of the trees. He’s happy to see me like always. He picks up his pace and trots over like a horse. His black tail swings back and forth. When I put the bowl on the ground, he nudges my hand before digging in. His nose is cold. 

It doesn’t take him long to eat everything in the bowl. When he’s done, I squat down and scratch behind his ears. My fingertips run along his fur. It’s coarse and damp, like he’s been rolling around in wet grass. Maybe he has. Who knows what Sacred does when I’m not around?

One thing I know for sure is I could never be a dog. They eat anything. Not me. I’m a picky eater. I don’t like avocados, peaches, green beans, or peas. I like corn, but only if it’s alone, sprinkled with salt and doused in butter. I like hamburgers, but not cheeseburgers. I like pizza, but only if it’s plain. I like clementines, but not oranges. They look almost the same, but they’re different. Clementines are much sweeter. Oranges just taste like oranges.

“Good boy,” I say.

Sacred doesn’t just take off and leave me when he’s done eating. My friendship with Sacred has a lot to do with the fact that I bring him food, but it’s not the only reason he likes me. I know this because he usually hangs around after he eats. He follows me, like an assistant. When I walk, he walks. When I sit down, he sits down. And when it’s time for me to leave, he always knows somehow and goes back into the woods so he can keep rolling around in the grass or whatever he does when he’s alone.

So Sacred and I walk across the clearing and I tell him what’s been going on in my life.

“School is out for the summer,” I say. “Everyone practically sprinted out of the building on the last day. I should be more excited, too, but I’m not. I’m not saying I like school—I mean, it’s okay—but at least it’s something to do. The good news is, I’ll be able to come out here and check on you more often. I wish you could come home with me, or just any nice home, but this will be the next best thing.”

We reach a fallen log that’s between two trees. It’s one of my favorite places to sit, and that’s exactly what I do when I get there. I sit on the log, and Sacred sits at my feet. 

“These people came by the house with pamphlets for their church,” I continue. “And later I’m going to meet a fortune-teller named Kaori Tanaka.”

Now that Sacred’s all caught up, I take my zoological diary out of my bag, along with my pencil. I’m here to document the squirrels. They’re my focus for the day. I like to pretend I’m Jane Goodall, except with squirrels instead of chimpanzees. It would be nice if there were chimpanzees in these woods, but that seems highly unlikely. Actually I’m not even sure there are chimpanzees anywhere in the United States, except for zoos. I’ll have to research that later. I write in my diary: where do chimps live? And I put a star next to it. Any time I put a star next to something, it means “research later.” I have a whole system going. You have to stay organized if you’re going to study wildlife. Otherwise your notes will become a complete disaster.

I hate to admit it, but I started my first zoological diary because of Roberta. We used to be good friends, a long time before she gave me that Famous Deaf People in History book. The only reason she even came to the party was because her mother made her. I could tell. It was the same with most of the other girls, too. But before that we were BFFs, even though she got on my nerves a lot. Back then Roberta liked exploring the woods. She doesn’t anymore—now she wears mascara, lip gloss, and sundresses—but back then, she liked to pretend that we were adventurers.

The only thing she was afraid of was snakes. Her dad had mentioned once that there were snakes in the woods, and from then on Roberta was terrified. To make her feel better, I learned everything I could about snakes. That way we’d know what to do to avoid getting bitten. I wrote it all down in a notebook. Here’s what I found out:

1. Never antagonize a snake. Don’t poke it with sticks or kick it or anything like that, unless you want it to bite you.

2. Never, never, never pick up a snake by its tail.

3. Stay out of tall grass.

4. If you see one, ignore it and walk away quietly. Most people get bitten when they try to get a closer look, or capture it.

5. If you get bitten and the snake is poisonous, seek medical attention immediately.

I shared all this information with Roberta, and she felt better. Life is a lot easier when you’re prepared for stuff.

I wish I had been prepared when Roberta and I stopped being friends.

You know how sometimes you’re friends with someone and they start hanging out with other people and eventually you’re not friends anymore, but you can’t remember when it all happened? Well, that’s not how it was with Roberta. I know the exact date: October twelfth, fourth grade. Roberta and the other girls were playing chase and I was doing my best to play, too. But after the game was over, she walked up to me and said, “We don’t want you to play with us anymore.”

“Why?” I asked, even though I already knew the answer.

“The how-tos are too hard,” she said. “And you’re too slow.”

The how-tos were what we called the three ways to talk so I could understand: face me, don’t cover your mouth, and speak clearly. 

When she said I was too slow, I knew what that meant, too. 

When we raced, I could never tell exactly when Megan Lewis called out, “Ready, set, go!” I could see she was getting ready to call it out, but I was never totally sure she had said all three words. When we played musical chairs, I couldn’t tell when the music stopped. With hide-and-seek, I never knew when ready-or-not-here-I-come happened. I always figured it out, but I was usually two or three steps behind everyone else. It slowed down the game. I knew that. I guess I just didn’t know that everyone else knew it, too. I thought I’d fooled them. But Roberta set me straight.

“Maybe you can find new friends,” she said.

Like I could snap my fingers and there they’d be.

That night, I cried on my mom’s lap. That’s how upset I was. And my mom said that if they were real friends, they would have figured out a game that all of us could play. I can’t stand when she says stuff like that. It makes me think she doesn’t get it. Bad friends were better than no friends. And besides, I thought they were my real friends in the first place. That was the whole reason I was crying.

But I’m solo now, and everything’s working out great.

I know I prayed to Saint Rene for a friend to protect me from Kaori Tanaka—just in case—but I’m over it. I’m doing just fine. Here I am, sketching in my journal, looking out for squirrels, with a loyal dog at my feet. He doesn’t care if I can’t hear him, and he doesn’t need any how-tos. 

What more could I ask for?
