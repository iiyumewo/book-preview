The Tiger of Elm Street



The Tanakas lived in an ordinary house on the opposite side of dense, hilly woods, at 1401 Maple Street. It wasn’t a far walk for Virgil; just cut through the woods, cross Elm and Ash, and voilà, he was there. But that would’ve just been too easy. Instead, fate (or bad luck, Virgil wasn’t sure which) had placed Chet Bullens’s house directly on the way to the Tanakas’, at 1417 Elm. And ninety percent of the time Chet, aka the Bull, was in his driveway shooting a basketball. Virgil’s parents complained that kids today never spent any time outside because they were too busy playing video games. But not the Bull. He haunted Elm Street like a tiger on the loose.

Virgil didn’t think of him as the Bull just because Chet’s last name was Bullens. The kid really was like a bull. Always ready to charge, always fired up to call Virgil a retard or pansy. Sometimes Virgil expected smoke to come spewing from Chet Bullens’s nostrils.

Virgil had to go several blocks out of his way to avoid 1417 Elm. It added minutes to the trip, but what else could he do? So when he emerged from the woods facing Elm Street, he immediately veered left, even though he could’ve walked one block right, crossed the street, and been at the Tanakas’ in no time at all.

He kept his head down and hooked his thumbs through the straps of his backpack. Walk, walk, walk. When you reach the house on the corner with the green door, turn right.

For whatever reason, Virgil had it in his head that if he didn’t make eye contact with anything, he would go unnoticed.

Not so.

“Hey, retard!” 

It came from behind him, a fairly good distance. But that didn’t mean anything. The Bull knew how to close distances faster than a speeding bullet.

Virgil’s heart gave one super-loud THUMP.

The turn-at-the-green-door plan wasn’t a fail-safe. Sometimes Chet wandered away from his house, thick hands still holding his basketball. It was inevitable.

Virgil didn’t look up. He picked up his pace. 

“Hey, RETARD! Don’t you know your own name?”

Virgil’s back dripped with sweat as he walked even faster. The sun was either getting hotter or Virgil’s nerves were getting weaker.

He heard quick movement behind him. Sneakers on concrete. 

Would the Bull push him down from behind? Bounce the basketball off his head? At school he usually just shoved him into the wall. The Bull had never actually thrown him down or beaten him up or anything. But there was a first time for everything.

The Bull’s sneakers came into view. Virgil smelled the Bull’s sweat and wondered if that’s how he smelled too.

“Where you goin’, retardo?” the Bull asked, walking alongside him like they were old buddies.

Virgil didn’t answer. Walk, walk, walk.

“Hey, lemme ask you something,” the Bull continued. “What’s five times five?”

Walk, walk, walk.

“You’re a retardo, so you probably don’t know, but five times five equals the number of times I made out with your sister.”

The Bull howled with laughter. Walk, walk. Virgil imagined an alternate reality, one where he stopped—feet firmly planted on the ground—and looked Chet Bullens square in the eye. 

“I don’t even have a sister, ignoramus,” Alternate Virgil would say. Then he’d grab the Bull’s shirt collar in his skinny little hand, the one with the fingers of a gifted pianist, and shove him against the nearest tree. “Take it back,” he’d say. But the Bull wouldn’t be able to talk because his collar would be too tight, so Virgil would lift him up with one hand and throw him across the neighborhood. The Bull would fly over thirty rooftops before landing on top of someone’s chimney, which would be burning hot even though it was summer and no one was using their fireplace. And he’d get stuck there and start cooking like a lump of pot roast.

But Alternate Virgil didn’t exist. Only Turtle. So instead of saying a single word, Virgil took off running.

The Bull didn’t chase him. He just laughed and laughed.
