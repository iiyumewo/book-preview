In Which a Story Is Told
Yes.
There is a witch in the woods. There has always been a witch.
Will you stop your fidgeting for once? My stars! I have never 
seen such a fidgety child.
No, sweetheart, I have not seen her. No one has. Not for ages. 
We’ve taken steps so that we will never see her.
Terrible steps.
Don’t make me say it. You already know, anyway. 
Oh, I don’t know, darling. No one knows why she wants chil￾dren. We don’t know why she insists that it must always be the 
very youngest among us. It’s not as though we could just ask her. 
She hasn’t been seen. We make sure that she will not be seen.

Of course she exists. What a question! Look at the woods! So 
dangerous! Poisonous smoke and sinkholes and boiling geysers 
and terrible dangers every which way. Do you think it is so by accident? Rubbish! It was the Witch, and if we don’t do as she says, 
what will become of us?
You really need me to explain it? 
I’d rather not.
Oh, hush now, don’t cry. It’s not as though the Council of Elders is coming for you, now is it. You’re far too old. 
From our family? 
Yes, dearest. Ever so long ago. Before you were born. He was 
a beautiful boy.
Now finish your supper and see to your chores. We’ll all be 
up early tomorrow. The Day of Sacrifice waits for no one, and 
we must all be present to thank the child who will save us for one 
more year.
Your brother? How could I fight for him? If I had, the Witch 
would have killed us all and then where would we be? Sacrifice one 
or sacrifice all. That is the way of the world. We couldn’t change 
it if we tried.
Enough questions. Off with you. Fool child.
